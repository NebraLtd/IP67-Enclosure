# IP67-Enclosure
Resources for the Nebra IP67 Die Cast Enclosure

Nebra IP67 waterproof/weatherproof enclosure for outdoor use. We recommend using this case for the Pi Supply IoT LoRa Gateway HAT for Raspberry Pi.

The industrial design with heavy-duty double hinges and spring-loaded captive screws sees the case a premier solution.

Designed to withstand the toughest environments, the outdoor enclosure is a light, yet very solid wireless outdoor enclosure that fits most boards in today's market.

Being NEMA-67 rated, it provides complete protection against ingress of dust as well as protection against immersion in water.

## Multiple Antenna Options
The N-Type antennas connectors are placed as far as possible from each other in order to increase spatial diversity and decrease RF grounding from the mounting mast.

Up to 5 antennas can be used for repeater operation, multiple band or MIMO smart antenna applications.

### Mount a Raspberry Pi and three HATs with this expansion board
This expansion board is designed to fit inside our Nebra IP67 waterproof/weatherproof case in conjunction with our LoRa Gateway HAT and any other two Raspberry Pi add on boards.

However, this board allows you to mount any other three HATs you'd like! The possibilities are endless. Swap out and switch HATs to your heart's content.

The board features 4 x 40 Pin headers - the standard header used on a Raspberry Pi. Three of these can be used to stack Raspberry Pi HATs and for the fourth you can connect a GPIO ribbon cable from it to the Raspberry Pi.

### Create your own Raspberry Pi LoRa Gateway powered over ethernet with a battery backup!

Create a modular Raspberry Pi LoRa Gateway by combining it with a variety of HATs to enhance the functionality. For example, add the Pi PoE Switch HAT and PiJuice HAT in order to power your gateway using PoE (Power over Ethernet) and reducing the need for a separate power cable. The PiJuice HAT is a UPS battery backup board with smart power functionalities and will keep your Raspberry Pi going if there's a power cut.
